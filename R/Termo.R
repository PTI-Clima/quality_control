#' @title Temperature records in Spain
#' @description This is a little sample of data which contains information about the temperature measured by six weather stations in Spain. The dataframe is formed by 6083 observations and 72 variables corresponding to the year 2022. The temperature is measured in degrees Celsius multiplied by ten to avoid decimals. It is worth mentioning that these data are invented, they do not correspond to real data. The aim is simply to have an example dataframe with similar characteristics to a real one.
